I"x<p>Today is the first day of my sabbatical! As a library faculty member on a 12-month contract, it is customary for us to get three months of leave in the summer on a five year cycle. For me, this sabbatical comes on the heels of my promotion to associate professor (!). It also marks the first time I have ever had any substantial opportunity to pursue my own research agenda. The nature of my work is very service-oriented. I teach, consult, and contribute to others’ learning, teaching, and research at my university and beyond. Even my publications reflect this direction. So when it came time to propose my sabbatical plans, I basically had to initialize a whole research agenda. It came together pretty easily after a little reflection, but I’m still adjusting to the idea that I am the one propelling my work, rather than other people. I know the opportunity for deep engagement will be beneficial for my professional (and personal) life, but right now it still feels like a major indulgence. I’ll go into my actual plans below, but for now, my top goal seems to be “figure out what it means to be a person on sabbatical.”</p>
