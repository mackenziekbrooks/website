I"û<p>Iâ€™ve switched this site from the <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a> to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. No complaints with Skeleton, but I liked the promise of Jekyll: blog-aware and Markdown support. I enjoy hand coding, but I should probably devote that kind of energy into TEI. It took me two sittings to figure out exactly what Iâ€™m doing with Jekyll, but it makes more sense now. <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/building-static-sites-with-jekyll--net-22211">This tutorial</a> helped, as did taking a minute to read through the .scss files instead of just blazing through with my CSS hammer. Iâ€™ve been taking notes in Markdown for the last few years, so being able to write in Markdown and a touch of YAML is nice.</p>
