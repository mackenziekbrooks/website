I"ß<p>During the weeks leading up to fall term, my institution puts on something we call â€œFall Academy.â€ Organized by Academic Technologies, faculty and staff gather for various training, refresher, or orientation sessions on technology, pedagogy, and university policies or practices. It is awesome. And exhausting.</p>

<p>This year, in addition to participating in our <a href="http://digitalhumanities.wlu.edu/blog/2015/07/29/day-of-dh-at-fall-academy-2015/">Day of DH</a>, I led a session called â€œSearch Everything.â€ Nominally this was about our using our discovery layer (Search Everything being the label we use on the library website), but I decided to take a broader approach.</p>

<p>Resetting expectations was my main motivation for this talk. Iâ€™m afraid I may have come off too harsh or defensive, but I was not going to stand for any card catalog nostalgia. Itâ€™s a complex world out there for information seekers. â€œToo big to knowâ€ as David Weinberger says.</p>

<p>My secondary motivation was to remind attendees that their students have almost always lived in a world where Google exists. I might be the youngest â€œprofessorâ€ on campus, so sometimes I find myself in this role of Millennial ambassador or translator. I used this presentation to tell the â€œadultsâ€ about student research habits and challenges, primarily through data from <a href="http://projectinfolit.org/">Project Information Literacy</a>. I also walked them through what I tell students about the very recent history of the internet.</p>

<p>I hope it was a useful talk. It was hard to prepare knowing that the audience would bring a wide range of experience. If nothing else, attendees learned to put search terms in quotes except in Google where you have to use Verbatim search, because Google.</p>
