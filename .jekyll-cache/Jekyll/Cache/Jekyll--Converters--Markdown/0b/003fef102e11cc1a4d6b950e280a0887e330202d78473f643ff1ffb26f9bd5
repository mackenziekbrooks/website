I"L<p>It’s been a year and a half since I assumed liaison responsibilities to the English department at MPOW. I won’t claim to have blossomed into the world’s best liaison, but I have been teaching one-shot instruction sessions on a regular basis. If you’ve spent any time in the instruction/information literacy world, then you know that most librarians are not a fan of the one-shot session. I’ve been “victim” to all the usual complaints: bad timing, course materials aren’t shared, limited time, no pre/post assessment, late notice, no stakes in the assignment, etc.</p>
