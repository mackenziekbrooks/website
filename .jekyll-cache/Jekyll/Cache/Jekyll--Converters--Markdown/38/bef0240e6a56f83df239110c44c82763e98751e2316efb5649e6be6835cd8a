I"N<p>This past weekend* I attended my second THATCamp. But before I talk about how wonderful it was, I want to spend a moment on my first THATCamp. It was the fall of 2011 and I had just finished up my MLIS program. I was working as a library assistant in a health sciences library, so my only outlet for DH-type work was a now-defunct project with my grad student boyfriend. Like most of grad school, it’s embarrassing to recall in much detail, but the theoretical goal was an online encyclopedia/wiki on “Literary Darwinism.”** In reality, it was a project that gave me an excuse to learn Drupal and gave some of my academically-minded friends a research project while they decided if grad school was actually a good idea. We took this project to THATCamp, proposed a session, and people showed up. Some of them even took us seriously.</p>
