Alternate title: why blog about teaching when you can just publish a new article for every class? 

I'm delighted to share this recent article in one of my favorite journals: Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy. [Born Digital Archives in the Undergraduate Classroom](https://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/born-digital-archives-in-the-undergraduate-classroom/) is a write-up of my first-year seminar taught in 2018. Through an educational partnership with [Archive-It](http://archive-it.org/), students worked to create their own web archive on a topic of their choosing. It was a fun class! The article covers my methods for introducing a first-year audience to archival theory and digital preservation. It's just a "View from the Field," so if you're looking for more detail, I suggest checking out the [syllabus](https://mackenziekbrooks.gitbooks.io/dh-180-born-digital/content/). I have no immediate plans to teach it again, but I hope it can inspire others to make use of born-digital archives in their own teaching.
